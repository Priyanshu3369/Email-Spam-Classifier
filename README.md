# Email Spam Classifier Web App

## Overview

This is a simple web application that classifies email messages as either "Spam" or "Not Spam" using machine learning. The app is built with Flask and uses a trained model for prediction. It provides an easy-to-use interface where you can paste an email message and get a spam classification result.

## Features

- **Spam Classification**: Classifies messages as either "Spam" or "Not Spam".
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes for a better user experience.
- **Interactive Interface**: Simple and attractive interface to paste email text and get predictions.
- **Model Integration**: Uses a trained machine learning model to classify messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the app
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For the frontend
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Text preprocessing and classification

## How to Use the App

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-classifier.git
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd email-spam-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
Hereâ€™s a list of dependencies included in requirements.txt:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Flask
scikit-learn
nltk
Step 3: Download or Train Model
Option 1: Using Pre-trained Model
If you don't want to train the model yourself, you can download a pre-trained model and vectorizer files (e.g., model.pkl and vectorizer.pkl), and place them in the project directory.

Option 2: Train the Model Yourself
To train your model:

You can use any dataset for spam classification (e.g., Enron Spam Dataset).

Preprocess the data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming).

Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) using scikit-learn.

Save the trained model and vectorizer as .pkl files.

Hereâ€™s how you might save the model and vectorizer:

python
Copy
Edit
import pickle

# Example: Saving the trained model and vectorizer
pickle.dump(model, open('model.pkl', 'wb'))
pickle.dump(tfidf_vectorizer, open('vectorizer.pkl', 'wb'))
Step 4: Run the Flask App
Once the dependencies are installed and the model is ready, run the Flask app with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
By default, the app will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Step 5: Access the App
Open your browser and navigate to:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
You should see the application interface where you can paste your email message in the text box and click the Check for Spam button to get the classification.

Step 6: (Optional) Toggle Dark Mode
Click on the moon icon (ðŸŒ™) to switch between dark and light themes.

Troubleshooting
Missing model or vectorizer files: If the model or vectorizer is missing, the app will not work. Make sure to download or train and save these files as explained in Step 3.

Missing Python dependencies: Ensure you have installed all the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
